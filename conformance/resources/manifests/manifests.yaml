# Base Kubernetes resources for the Gateway API Inference Extension conformance tests.
# This includes namespaces and a minimal set of resources (Gateway, Backend)
# required by many tests. More specific resources should be defined within
# individual test files or other resource directories (e.g., sample_backends).

# Namespace for core infrastructure like Gateways.
