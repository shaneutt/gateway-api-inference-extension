# Basic InferencePool for acceptance testing.
# This manifest defines the minimal required fields to create valid
# InferencePool and HTTPRoute resources, which the InferencePoolAccepted
# test will use to verify that the controller recognizes and accepts the resource.

# --- Minimal Backend Deployment (using agnhost echo server) ---
# This Deployment provides Pods for the InferencePool to select.
